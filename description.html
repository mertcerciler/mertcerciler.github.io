      <p class="description-writing">For some couple of years, the status of Turkish economy has deteriorated.
        Inflation has been increasing among these years and Turkish Lira has been losing its value against foreign
        currencies especially American Dollar, and Euro. Thus, the prices of all kinds of products of all kinds of
        industries (such as technology, fabric, etc.) have been explicitly increasing. Specifically the increasing
        price of food and beverage industry has a huge effect on peoples' daily lives. When it comes to socializing,
        especially with friends whether it is a special day or not the economy side of having fun is sometimes becomes
        a burden on one's shoulders. Therefore, restaurants have special campaigns in order to attract their potential
        clients to visit their restaurants. They put their low priced or under-sold products to the campaigns for a specific
        time interval. However, there is no way to announce their campaigns to a social platform except social media to the
        possible customers. Therefore O-Asis came as an idea to help people to save their time and preserve their economy
        with less effort compared to searching restaurants blindly on the streets. In a sense O-Asis will bring the streets’
        view in a similar way as Google Maps does to the users, in addition to that it will act as an assistance for finding
        promotions related to restaurants. </p>

        In O-Asis there are two types of users: restaurant clients and owners. Restaurant owners can create two different
        types of campaign such as permanent campaign and momentarily campaign. Permanent campaign will have no time
        limit on the other hand the momentarily campaign will have a time limit that is granted by the restaurant owners.
        Momentarily campaign will be potentially created by restaurant owners in the case of when their restaurant has a 
        few number of customers than usual. Restaurant owners can create this kind of campaign for a limited hours such as 
        one hour, two hours etc. Restaurant clients will be able to observe the available campaigns that are created by the
        restaurant owners. There are two different ways of getting information about the campaigns in O-Asis: first one is by
        streets’ view in a similar way as Google Maps does but there is an important difference. O-Asis shows the restaurants
        if and only if the restaurant has active campaign. Secondly, restaurant clients will have the option to follow their
        favorite restaurants if they wish so that they can get notifications about those places. The notification system works
        in such a way that, when there is a change occurs in any campaign including adding a campaign, changing ingredients,
        restaurant clients will be informed via notification system.

      <p class="description-writing">The most important feature of O-Asis is the machine learning algorithm
        that works in back-end. Restaurant owners are going to enter all the products that they sold to a list
        which will serve as a data set to be analyzed by that machine learning algorithm. With the help of this
        algorithm, restaurant owners can see which of their products are being sold less than other products and
        which of their products are being sold commonly. Based on the analysis of the algorithm, O-Asis is going
        to give the campaign recommendations that can increase that particular restaurant’s sales.
